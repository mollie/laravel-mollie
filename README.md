## Upgrading from v2.x?
To support the enhanced Mollie API, some breaking changes were introduced. Make sure to follow the instructions in the [upgrade guide](UPGRADE.md).

Fresh install? Continue with the installation guide below.

## Installation

Add Laravel-Mollie to your composer file via the `composer require` command:

```bash
composer require mollie/laravel-mollie
```

Or add it to `composer.json` manually:

```json
"require": {
    "mollie/laravel-mollie": "^3.0"
}
```

Laravel-Mollie's service providers will be automatically registered using Laravel's auto-discovery feature.

## Configuration

You'll only need to add the `MOLLIE_KEY` variable to your `.env` file.

```php
MOLLIE_KEY=test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Example usage

Here you can see an example of just how simple this package is to use.

### A payment using the Mollie API

```php
use Mollie\Laravel\Facades\Mollie;

public function preparePayment()
{
    $payment = Mollie::api()->payments->create([
        "amount" => [
            "currency" => "EUR",
            "value" => "10.00" // You must send the correct number of decimals, thus we enforce the use of strings
        ],
        "description" => "Order #12345",
        "redirectUrl" => route('order.success'),
        "webhookUrl" => route('webhooks.mollie'),
        "metadata" => [
            "order_id" => "12345",
        ],
    ]);

    // redirect customer to Mollie checkout page
    return redirect($payment->getCheckoutUrl(), 303);
}

/**
 * After the customer has completed the transaction,
 * you can fetch, check and process the payment.
 * This logic typically goes into the controller handling the inbound webhook request.
 * See the webhook docs in /docs and on mollie.com for more information.
 */
public function handleWebhookNotification(Request $request) {
    $paymentId = $request->input('id');
    $payment = Mollie::api()->payments->get($paymentId);

    if ($payment->isPaid())
    {
        echo 'Payment received.';
        // Do your thing ...
    }
}
```
